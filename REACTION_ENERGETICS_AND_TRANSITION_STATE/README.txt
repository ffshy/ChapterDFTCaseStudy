Notes:

	1) For transition state calculations in ./GAS_PHASE_ISOMERIZATION and ./H2O_CATALYZED_ISOMERIZATION, the optimized 
           reactant and product structures are copied from ../STRUCTURAL_PROPERTIES_HY_PY_AND_HYH2O/calc/    

	2) After locating the transition state structure, make sure that this stucture has only one imaginary frequency 
           (represented as negative values) and its vibration leads to reactant and product structures in the two opposite directions.

	3) For XYG3, we use B3LYP structures. For G3, we also use previous .chk files to provide initial structures. Please note 
           that .chk files are all deleted to save disc space.
