Notes:

	1) To perform XYG3 calculation, you will need xDH4Gau script, 
           "run_xDH_using_Gaussian.py". You can find it from https://github.com/igor-1982/xDH4Gau 

	2) XYG3 is based on B3LYP optimized geometry structures and B3LYP orbitals. 
           We add the electronic energy of XYG3 and zero-point correction of B3LYP to 
           give E(0K) of XYG3.
